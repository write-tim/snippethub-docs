## General Questions

### Does SnippetHub work offline?
Yes! SnippetHub stores all your snippets locally in Chrome's indexed storage. You can create, edit, search, and copy snippets without an active internet connection. When you reconnect, any changes automatically sync to Firebase.

### Is my data secure and private?
Yes. SnippetHub never sells your data or uses your snippets for tracking or advertising. If you sign in, snippets are transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections directly to your authenticated Firebase cloud database.

### Can I format code in multiple programming languages?
Yes. SnippetHub integrates with Highlight.js, supporting auto-detection and syntax highlighting for JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS, JSON, SQL, Bash, and more.

### How do dynamic variables work?
When a snippet contains `{{date}}` or `{{time}}`, SnippetHub evaluates today's timestamp at the moment you copy or insert the snippet. If it contains custom variables like `{{client:Client Name}}`, an interactive prompt asks you to fill in the variable before inserting.

### Can I contribute to or edit these documentation articles?
Yes! This support site is built on a **docs-as-code** model. You can edit articles via [Sveltia CMS Admin](../admin/) or submit pull requests directly to the [SnippetHub GitHub repository](https://github.com/tmj51578/snippethub).
