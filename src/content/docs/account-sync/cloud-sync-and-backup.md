Never lose your snippet collection when upgrading computers or switching workstations.

## Cloud Synchronization

SnippetHub uses Firebase to securely store and sync your snippets in the cloud.

### Signing In
1. Open the SnippetHub side panel.
2. Click **Sign In with Google** for instant authentication with your browser account, or use **Email and Password**.
3. Once logged in, snippets, folders, and custom tags sync across any Chrome instance where you are signed into SnippetHub.

## Offline Mode

SnippetHub is offline-first. All snippets are cached in Chrome's local storage:
- You can create, edit, search, and copy snippets even without an active internet connection.
- When you reconnect to the network, your changes are automatically synchronized to the cloud in the background.

## Manual Backup (Export & Import)

To create local backups or migrate snippets:

### Exporting Snippets
1. Click the user avatar menu in the top-right corner.
2. Select **Dashboard** or **Export**.
3. Download a `.json` backup file containing your complete snippet library, categories, and tags.

### Importing Snippets
1. From the menu, select **Import Snippets**.
2. Select your JSON backup file.
3. SnippetHub will merge the imported snippets into your library without overwriting existing entries.
